        <h2>IAM: Security & Identity</h2>
        <p><strong>Hawk-Eye View:</strong> IAM is the "bouncer and keymaster" of your AWS account. It answers the question: "Who can do what?" Nothing happens in AWS without passing through IAM.</p>
        <div class="deep-dive-section">
            <h4>For the Data Engineer, Focus On:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IAM Roles:</strong> This is the most critical concept. AWS services (like Glue, Lambda, EMR) need permissions to act on other services (like reading from S3). You **NEVER** give them a user's access key. Instead, you create an IAM Role with a specific policy (e.g., `S3ReadAccess`) and assign that role to the service. The service then temporarily assumes this role to get the credentials it needs.</li>
                <li><strong>IAM Policies:</strong> These are JSON documents that explicitly define permissions. The fundamental structure is `Effect` (`Allow`/`Deny`), `Action` (the API call, e.g., `s3:GetObject`), and `Resource` (the ARN of the thing you're acting on).</li>
                <li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager:</strong> When your Glue job or Lambda function needs to connect to a database like Redshift, you do not hardcode the password in your script. You store the password in Secrets Manager, and you give your IAM Role permission to *read that specific secret*.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="well-architected">
                <strong>Well-Architected Pillar (Security): The Principle of Least Privilege</strong>
                <p>Always grant the absolute minimum permissions required. If a Glue job only needs to read from the `raw/` prefix and write to the `processed/` prefix in S3, its IAM role policy should specify exactly those resource paths, not `s3:*` on `*`.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>VPC: Networking</h2>
        <p><strong>Hawk-Eye View:</strong> A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is your own logically isolated section of the AWS cloud. It's your private network where you launch your resources.</p>
        <div class="deep-dive-section">
            <h4>For the Data Engineer, Focus On:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Security Groups:</strong> This is a stateful firewall for your resources (like an EC2 instance or Redshift cluster). It controls what traffic is allowed **in** and **out**. For example, you would configure a Redshift cluster's security group to only allow inbound traffic on port 5439 from the security group of your Glue connection.</li>
                <li><strong>VPC Endpoints:</strong> This is a critical concept for data engineering. By default, if a Lambda function in your VPC wants to talk to S3, it has to go out to the public internet. A **VPC Endpoint** creates a private, secure connection directly from your VPC to an AWS service without leaving the AWS network. This is more secure and can be faster.
                    <ul>
                        <li>`Gateway Endpoint`: For S3 and DynamoDB.</li>
                        <li>`Interface Endpoint`: For most other services, like Kinesis, Glue, and Secrets Manager.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
             <p><strong>Visualization: Secure Data Access</strong></p>
            <pre>[Lambda in Private Subnet] ---> [S3 VPC Endpoint] ---> [S3 Bucket]</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>EC2 & EBS: Compute & Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>Hawk-Eye View:</strong> EC2 instances are the virtual servers that provide compute power. EBS volumes are their network-attached hard drives.</p>
        <div class="deep-dive-section">
            <h4>For the Data Engineer, Focus On:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When you'll see them:</strong> While many data services are serverless (Glue, Lambda, Athena), some require you to manage clusters of EC2 instances, most notably **Amazon EMR**.</li>
                <li><strong>Instance Families:</strong> You should know the basics. If your Spark job is doing heavy calculations, you might choose a **Compute Optimized** (`c` family) instance. If it needs to cache a massive lookup table in memory, you'd choose a **Memory Optimized** (`r` or `x` family).</li>
                <li><strong>EBS vs. Instance Store:</strong> **EBS** is persistent, network-attached block storage (your virtual C: drive). **Instance Store** is temporary storage physically attached to the host machine. It is incredibly fast but the data is **deleted** if the instance stops or terminates. It's good for temporary shuffle space for Spark jobs on EMR.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Encryption: Data Protection</h2>
        <p><strong>Hawk-Eye View:</strong> Protecting data both when it's moving (in-transit) and when it's stored (at-rest).</p>
        <div class="deep-dive-section">
            <h4>For the Data Engineer, Focus On:</h4>
            <p>For the exam, you need to understand the **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** options for S3.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> This is ensuring connections use TLS/SSL. Most AWS services enforce this by default.</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>SSE-S3</code>: The baseline. AWS manages the encryption keys for you. You just check a box to enable it on your S3 bucket.</li>
                        <li><code>SSE-KMS</code>: You use the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). This gives you more control and auditability. You create a Customer Managed Key (CMK) and grant IAM roles permission to *use* that key for encryption and decryption. This is a very common pattern for enhanced security.</li>
                        <li><code>Client-Side Encryption</code>: You encrypt the data on your application *before* you send it to AWS. This provides the most security but is also the most complex to manage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="well-architected">
                <strong>Well-Architected Pillar (Security): Encryption by Default</strong>
                <p>An architect ensures that all data landing in the S3 data lake is encrypted at rest. You would enable default encryption on the S3 bucket, often specifying `SSE-KMS` and using a specific KMS key that you control access to via IAM policies. This ensures that even if data is accidentally made public, it remains encrypted.</p>
